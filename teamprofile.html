        <p>Pham Tran Viet Anh s3748838, 20 years old. I was obligated for content writing and organizing campaigns and events during my time in RMIT Mass Media Club and Marketing and Communication Club. I am often considered as a pleasant, outgoing, sociable and open-minded, so I can quickly make new friends, attend activities which I enjoyed during my university life.Its funny how I just take a couple of steps around campus and I always have to wave and greet someone I know! I went on a two-semester Exchange to Canada from September 2019 until March of 2020. By the time I got back, I was pleased and excited to see my friends – who heartwarmingly greeted me after a year apart – and to share all the stories. Later on I was contacted by the Student Academic Success for their Program Tutors recruitment and I believe with my experience of Marketing at RMIT, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and Ryerson University can help other students get a better grip on their studies. I am interests in the field of SQL database, Big Data and designing websites. Such aspects are very important and key to my career as a digital marketer. In addition, I would like to work in the market analysis sector like famously known Nielsen, so I need to learn a lot of analytical and technological expertise along with data processing experience.

        <p>Pham Nguyen Mai Ly s3749562, 20 years old One of my hobbies are cooking in my free time and since I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh city, my food culture was dependent solely on Vietnamese cuisines such as “Pho” or “Banh mi” are my all-time favorite dishes. Being a Gen Z, there were many technological advancements since the 2000s of which I was quickly familiarized with. One piece of tech that got my interest was VR which was applicable in many fields such as Medical Training – where students can do virtual operations to practice or Fashion – customers can try clothes virtually. Big Data is an example of the close relationship between IT and digital marketing. Primarily, the role of a business analyst is to thoroughly grasp consumer insights at the micro scale. To capture and store such large knowledge as Big Data, tools such as the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) framework are highly useful (Ribant 2016). Through using the CRM framework, business researchers are able to update customer data in real time, strengthen customer relationships and eventually increase revenue. Marketers should also have IT expertise to use such programs.

        <p>Le Van Vinh s3823614, 24 years old. I was born in Da Lat city, Lam Dong province. When I turned 13, I moved to Ho Chi Minh City to live with my brother and sister. When I turned 17, I started my independent life by moving to San Jose city, California, United States. In my spare time, I usually play video games or hang out with my friends. When you don’t know me, you might consider me as distant. However, once you get to know me, you’ll find out that I talk a lot, and am very friendly. I was interested in IT because I was always fascinated by computers and their capabilities. I like to learn more about computers, both in hardware and software. I worked as an iPad IT intern for my high school in America. In my high school, we used the iPad for every learning activity. My primary responsibility was to help students identify and fix problems with their iPad. I’ve also built and upgraded several personal computers as a hobby. I am working my way through the IT world, so that I will be able to do many more sophisticated IT projects in the future, as well as building myself a more modern life with the help of IT. I am very much interested in the data management aspect of IT, since I believe that data is very important in building, or testing anything new, and keeping track, sorting, and analyzing data plays a big role in data management.

        <p>Phan Tuan Viet s3747573, 20 years old. I was born in the heart of Saigon, as a benefit of learning at VUS very early, I am fluent in English and Vietnamese. I have a hobby in bartending which I took interest in a few years’ back. Now I can fix a decent amount of drinks (granted that I have the alcohol) and plan on opening a bar in the future. I initially intended to spend 2 semesters exchange program to Melbourne Australia. However, my plans were cut short due to Covid and I was only able to stay for a couple of months from February 2020 to March 2020.One interesting thing is I used to dreamt of working in the IT industry because I was into gaming and would want to make games. The process of game development is a long and complex operation which involves many aspects such as Story writing, designing, testing, bug fixing and also marketing. In the field of marketing, IT knowledge is still crucial, such skills like website designing, Photoshop and data analysis would help differentiate myself from other candidates.</p>

        <p>Lee Gain (이가인) s3878170. I am from South Korea so I can speak Korean, English, and some Vietnamese. I am currently studying abroad. Although living in another country is sometimes hard for me due to the difference in culture, I believe I learned a lot of things in Vietnam with new friends and I hope this experience extends my viewpoint. I usually spend my time playing games, writing novels, and painting. Recently I have an interest in drawing characters so I am going to study drawing on vacation. I am a beginner in this field so I do not have many experiences related to IT. However, I am interested in various fields. I have been paying attention to the role of IT in agriculture in recent days. The fact that people can harvest various plants regardless of the climate was fascinating for me. For example, some plants can be grown up in a specific place that does not have enough sunlight since a smart farm will provide alternative light having similar effects to sunlight. Moreover, people can purchase cherries in the country belonging to the tropical climate. The reason for this smart farm will offer and maintain appropriate temperatures and humidity. It might lead to reducing carbon footprint because people do not have to import specific foods that cannot be harvested in their country from other places. This novel technique seems deeply interesting to me and I wish to contribute to preserving the environment by developing services or products.</p>
