            <h4>Topic</h4>
            <p>
              Robots and AI (Artificial Intelligence) have always been considered to be mostly fictional and would usually “only be seen on TV”. However, that statement was proven to no longer be true with the rapid speed of which AI is being developed; As of now, the combination of technological advancements such as Big data analytics, sensors, AI, speech recognition, etc. Service robots are on the rise and have come into our everyday life – which is also the heart and soul of this team project (Paluch S, et al. 2020).
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of this project, through devising ideas, research, trials and errors, our customers can expect a functional service robot that can help with many aspects of its owner’s life. Utilizing sophisticated concepts namely Artificial Intelligence – simulating human by thinking and mimicking, alongside with the ability to learn and solve problems (Frankenfield J 2021); Cloud computing – storing and analyzing data over “the cloud” for speed, flexibility and security of information (Microsoft Azure n.d.); Consolidation of fire/smoke sensors, wifi as well as Bluetooth for manual control and access to household appliances. Such a project would need a more significant team with a variety of expertise in IT as well as engineers in order to deliver the scope of the proposal.
            </p>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>
              On average, Vietnamese collar workers work for 48 hours a week meaning 8 hours a day, six days a week (Vietnam Labor Law 2019). Therefore, work hours in Vietnam are considered much longer compared to the US which is 34.4 hours/week for instance. After finishing work, they usually spend an average 2.20 hours daily (not including time spent on child caring or overtime work) doing household chores. Subsequently, more time for work and chores mean less time for family and entertainment; According to Jen Wong and David Almeida 2012, daily buildup of stress without proper relieves would change their behavior around other people and eventually be harmful to their families. Not to mention Vietnam’s high crime rate in Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi where reports of domestic helpers stealing from their employers (VNExpress 2020). As a result, a service robot like AZ Butler can help them with their wellbeing and enhance security of their household. This project also implements technology trends sparked up by Vietnam’s adoption of Industry 4.0 such as Robotics, cloud computing and Artificial Intelligence (Nguyen T & Luu K 2020). A realization of working on this project would reflect Programming skills – proficiency in multiple programming languages, Problem-solving – shows clear understanding of robotics in order to troubleshoot of which issues are frequent in IT, Design knowledge – create an intricate system that is efficient and looks good, Communication skill – necessary skill to work in any team (NRTC Automation 2020).   
            </p>
            
            <h4>Landscape</h4>
            <p>
              Robots featuring AI are still actively in development all around the world and come in many types. AI assistants exist in most flagship smartphones namely Siri, Google Assistant or the more advanced Amazon Alexa. There is also the humanoid AI capable of communicating with humans, performing simple tasks and entertainment; For example, Pepper the social humanoid robot that can recognize your facial expression and emotion to engage with you through conversation and his chest-mounted touch screen (SoftBank Robotics n.d.). UBTechs from China invented Walker – a service robot capable of picking up objects, pouring liquid, opening and closing doors and even doing yoga.  
            </p>
            <p>
              In Vietnam, the competitive landscape is different where professional humanoid service robots have not existed yet. Instead, many of the service robots’ presence in this market are mainly vacuum cleaner robots from brands like Ecovacs. These types of robots integrated much simpler forms of Machine Learning as they are able to learn and memorize floor plans, patterns and preset paths. On the other hand, our project AZ Butler possesses a much higher intelligent AI which it can use to automatically operate any appliances it connects to. i.e. AZ Butler can switch the lights and AC on or off depending on the owner's location in the house, checks the fridge and notify on food shortage, controls the surveillance system to check for intruders and owners, etc. In a nutshell, compared to what is available in the Vietnamese service robots market, AZ Butler will be the pioneer of amelioration for Vietnam’s technology, a prime example of Industry 4.0 utilization.
