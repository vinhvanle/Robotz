        <h4>Scope and Limits</h4>
        <p>
            This project’s goal is to create a robot butler that will automatically patrol around, providing surveillance and security for the premise while being able to help manage the house by connecting with other appliances in the house and give instructions to those appliances when needed. The security options the robot can offer are video surveillance and hazard alerts. The robot can also provide some quality of life features such as vacuum cleaning and temperature control. With the help of AI technology, this robot will be able to adapt to new environments when introduced. Some limitations that this robot might have including the AI technology applied to it might not yet be fully developed for some situations since this is a new project and the team plans to develop a new AI system for this robot, getting the data and developing the AI technology using data gathered will need a longer timeline. Another limitation to this project might be relating to the team’s inexperience in the field of coding language, and hardware assembling. 
        </p>
        <h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
        <p>The first key component is an Arduino microcontroller. It serves as the brain of the robot. An Arduino microcontroller will power and control other components that are connected to make a functioning robot. Four motors that are connected to wheels serve as legs of the robot. An ultrasonic sensor, and a line tracking module is used as the eyes of the robot. They enable the robot to track the path and avoid any obstacle on the way. A Bluetooth module is used so that the user can connect and change the setting of the robot if needed. To enable the surveillance feature of the robot, a camera will be installed. </p>
        <p>The main coding tool used will be Arduino IDE provided by Arduino. The coding language used is C programming language. The syntax used is slightly different from a generic C programming language because Arduino IDE is built only for Arduino microcontroller with the purpose of reducing coding difficulty level for users. An Arduino code contains three main parts: functions, variables, and structures. The functions part of the code serves mainly for controlling the Arduino board and performing computations needed. The Variables part of the code serves mainly to set up constants and data types that will be used in computations. The structure part contains the main loop for the program which will tell the Arduino board what to do. Any personal computer or laptop that has USB connection ports that can install and run the Arduino IDE is sufficient enough for this project. 
        </p>
        <p>Vinh is the one taking care of the technical part of this project because he has prior knowledge of computer language and electrical engineering. Vinh also has some experience working with Arduino microcontroller. </p>
        <p>
            The next important technology that will be used in this project is AI technology. AI technology will enable the robot to adapt to the new owner’s household. Because each house is equipped with different appliances and different terrains, the robot will need to learn the surroundings and what’s provided to devise a course of action that is suitable for the house it is in. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Robotics knowledge is also very important for this project. The robot will need to take humanoid form to create an approachable and likable feeling for the owner. Moreover, to be able to perform numerous daily tasks in the most efficient way, the material used, and the form of each part of the robot is also crucial. 
        </p>
        <h4>Testing</h4>
        <h4>Time frame</h4>
        <h4>Risks</h4>
        <p>
            There are a few risks identified while working on the project. The first risk appeared when assembling the robot. There are lots of wire connections. Each connection has to be precise and accurate in order for the sensors to work properly. Each sensor has multiple wires that have to be connected to the specific pin of the microcontroller. Moreover, there is a risk of short-circuiting the board if the components and the battery are connected incorrectly. In fact, the first time we built the robot, a bad connection was made between the servos and the battery, causing a short-circuit that burnt the battery module. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The next risk that we will face is setting the correct constants for the servos that control the robot’s movement. It is complicated to code the four separate servos to work well with each other to make the robot’s movement smoothly. To avoid wasting time, we decided to have the robot make distinct movements. For example, if the robot wants to turn left, it needs to stop moving forward, turns left, then continues forward. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The next risk that might pop up is the problem of water resistance. The robot is made of many delicate sensors that have many electrical connections within. A single water problem might compromise the whole system.
        </p>
        <p>
            When applying AI technology for the robot, there will also be a risk that we need to look out for, that is the learning model might not cover some unique situations that we have not thought of when developing. We will need to constantly update and test the learning model for the robot so that it can adapt better to new situations. Moreover, in the process of working, the robot might malfunction in a way that the action course it developed is not suitable or not the most efficient way.
        </p>

        <h4>Group processes and communications</h4>
        <p>
            Communication is the most crucial key in a team project. To achieve a successful project, our team decided on three communication means which are face-to-face meetings, Discord, and Facebook messenger. These methods were used based on a different purpose. The team also established the team's rules to deal with irresponsible behavior. For instance, if a member did not perform their duty on time, the member should explain his or her situation. Team members will give some advice and support a member as much as possible. However, the team will possibly report vital concerns to the lecturer as long as the irresponsible actions of a member still occur over five times. 
        </p>
        <h5> - Face-to-face meeting </h5>
        <p>
            Our team had a face-to-face meeting in the RMIT meeting room regularly. Considering each member's schedules, It was appropriate that the meeting was opened every Tuesday after the tutorial. At that time, we concentrated on proposing new opinions and making a weekly plan. The team shared novel ideas, discussed the opinion's practicability which brings positive consequences to our project, and applied it if the proposal was useful. Our team also designed weak schemes. The plan was changed every week depending on the process of the project and unpredictable issues. The divide and conquer strategy was utilized on the project, specifically, our team determined small objectivities every week and made efforts to reach goals. This tactic was useful to encourage team members because the team can feel a sense of achievement and ultimately accomplish the project.
        </p>
        <h5> -  Discord</h5>
        <p>
            Regular online meetings are also held on every Friday by using Discord. The purpose of the online meeting was to confirm an overall weekly plan and deal with unexpected technical problems.  In the meeting, each team member reported their progress and issues if it exists. The operation manager evaluated the current state of the team process and presented accomplished and ongoing objectives to the team. Our team also spent time solving technical concerns. For example, the team used screen share service in discord to identify occurring issues more specifically and made efforts to discover solutions or alternatives. The team member also recommended a fruitful website or references which might be useful to resolve the problems. Online meetings were arranged on Monday or Wednesday every time it was necessary. 
        </p>
        <h5> - Facebook messenger</h5>
        <p>
            The major contact method of the team was a Facebook messenger. Our team utilized it to stay connected with each other and inform modification. One example of this was that the team scheduled regular appointments. Several team members sometimes explained logical reasons when they cannot attend the meeting unavoidably.  The operation manager also announced the topic of each meeting, new weekly objectives, and changes to let the team recognize the current state of the project and allow team members who are absent with reasonable issues to follow the plan. Another example was the team frequently using the application to notify modification of files on the team's GitHub to prevent common conflicts due to disordered git commands.
        </p>
        <h4>Skills and Jobs</h4>
        <p>
            The ultimate goal of the project is developing a robot and providing services to manage the consumer's house efficiently. To achieve the objectives, our team should design and assemble the robot. The team also has to promote the product. Therefore, the project needs overall four positions which are advertising manager, robotics engineer, app developer and IT manager.
        </p>
        <h5>Advertising Manager</h5>
        <p>In order to promote our product, the project needs to employ an advertising manager. The advertising manager is responsible for directing the advertising for the product. Overall, they are researching current trends among expected customers, designing promoting methods and advertising in various ways. Negotiation skill, organizing information skill and experiences related to marketing might be anticipated to advertising managers. Regarding most projects that have some limitations such as budget and time, advertising managers should be adept at negotiation with people like media firms which provide time or space for advertising. Organizing skills are also significant in designing appropriate promotion by gathering and analyzing information related to the project. Moreover, it might be useful if they have experience in sales or marketing or have a degree in advertising or journalism.</p>
        <h5>Robotics Engineer</h5>
        <p>Robotics engineer is an essential occupation in the project considering the objective of the project is making a robot. Robotics engineer works for building robots. The major tasks of the robotic engineer are creating a blueprint of robots and constructing it by assembling the unit. Sometimes they are also in charge of researching the usage of a robot. To construct robots, several skills might be expected such as communication skill, creativity and degree in robotics engineering. It may be impossible to build a robot by oneself in six months because the work has numerous duties. In other words, a robotics engineer will possibly work as a team. Considering this, communication skills are an essential skill for robotics engineers. Thinking out of the box is also important to invent novel products as a pioneer in the robotic area.  The engineer might have to specialize in robotics like mechanical engineering, electrical engineering or industrial engineering since the work requires tremendous knowledge in the field. </p>
        <h5>App Developer</h5>
        <p>An app developer might be a crucial position on the project. The main tasks of an app developer will be analyzing prospects clients' behaviour and developing an application to offer the user connection with the robot. Approximately three skills are required which are analytical skill, communication skill and technical skills. App developers tend to make an application based on the behaviour of the user to provide the most effective services so they should be proficient at analyzing massive information. As app developers work mostly as a team, communication skills are also essential to convey an individual's ideas. Degree in computer science or computer programming also helpful for an app developer. The reason for this may be that they should be expert in a typical programming language such as C, C++ and python as well as understand not only several operation systems of application </p>
        <h5>IT Manager</h5>
        <p>This project needs a number of technologies so it requires various machines. To maintain the technical system and provide sufficient tools, the project should hire an IT Manager. The IT manager is responsible for managing infrastructure and inspecting equipment used in the project to guarantee the tools run properly all the time. There are three anticipated conditions for an IT Manager, which are having communication skills, planning skills and some degree of knowledge. The IT manager will probably communicate with numerous people in various fields. Most of them probably do not have much knowledge of technology. To communicate with them, the IT manager needs to be skilful at delivering their opinions. Additionally, planning is one of the crucial skills for the IT manager in that they consider cost-effectiveness to satisfy both the project budget and needs of specific equipment. A degree related to IT like engineering, information science or computer science will be beneficial to manage tools effectively.</p>
