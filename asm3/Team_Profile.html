          <h4> Team Name</h4>
          <p>
            Figuring out a team name that is satisfactory to everyone can be difficult sometimes so we thought “How about naming it nothing at all?”. That’s the reason we came up with the error message – 404 Not Found! is a common error code usually found when browsing the internet, it happens when users tried to access a page that is no longer exist on the host’s server.
          </p>
          <h4>Personal Information</h4>
          <h4>Group Processes</h4>
          <p>
            Ideas and opinions are always fluctuating which is natural for any team projects. The team tried their best in the first week to elevate this at-first-simple robot idea into a more advanced, smart and fully automated butler. However, due to some difference in opinions, the team still struggles to find the right level where they should take this robot to. Around the second week of the project, a new member was introduced into the team which she is an enormous help and support for the team. Although the new member is Korean, there were no language barriers between the teammates and they managed to work together flawlessly.
          </p>
          <h4>Career Plans</h4>
          <p>
            Three out of five team members (Viet Anh, Mai Ly and Tuan Viet) took interests in the marketing department but have rather diverse thoughts on their Ideal Jobs. They think that the knowledge and experience can help them further down their career paths, aspects such as Big Data analysis, SQL database, CRM framework as well as website designing skills like HTML, CSS, Photoshop and Premiere are emphasized to be essential as marketers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Viet Anh shared that ultimate goal is to become a Social and Digital manager at Ogilvy – well-known global marketing and advertising agency. That being said, before he can apply to such a tough position, he would need to first hone his data analysis ability through working for a Market Analysis company, namely Nielsen. In addition, if the opportunity prevails, he would apply for a Marketing Executive position in Amsterdam where he previously studied to gather experience then work his Ideal job in Vietnam afterwards. The career plan is somewhat similar to Mai Ly since she also wanted to work as an Analyst for her Ideal Job. A Market Research Analyst would require at least two years of experience in market researching field as well as data visualization and competence use of IT tools namely SEO/SEM, website design, statistical softwares.
