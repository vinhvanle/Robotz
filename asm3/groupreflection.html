        <h4>Le Van Vinh:</h4>
        <p>
          "Viet Anh is very energetic and always comes up with new ideas. He is also very persuasive and artistic. Viet is a silent doer, he always delivers on the tasks he is given on time so that the team’s progress stays on track as much as possible. Mai Ly is the person responsible for dividing tasks for each team member, and she really cares about the quality of the work each member has contributed. She would check and give instant feedback on those work to maintain the overall quality. Gain Lee is always the first person to deliver on any of the work assigned, I think this gives the rest of the team inspiration to work hard to keep up with her performance. Moreover, she is not afraid to ask questions, this is very important in teamwork. Personally, I am not very creative so I try my best to deliver on the technical stuff that is needed for the project with the knowledge that I already have. I also try to listen to every team member’s idea and try to resolve conflicts within the team." 
        </p>
        <h4>Lee Ga In:</h4>
        <p>
          "Vinh Van Le was the major developer designing a machine. He dedicated much time to build a functional product. Although some barriers occurred when designing it, he attempted to solve it. As a result, the attitude of him inspired the overall team positively. Pham Tran Viet Anh was the most creative and imaginative member of the team. Because of his lots of ideas, the team were capable of presenting the product with aesthetic and effective presentation. Mai Ly also performed well. She divided each task depending on an individual's strength and confirmed the progress of each member to encourage them to follow the plan. I believe that the team was able to complete the project on time because of her. Tuan Viet gave us many advice and feedback to each member which not only helped to maintain the quality of the performance but also avoided stereotypes by adopting a variety viewpoint. As a new member and foreigners of the team, I made efforts to contribute to the project, especially in communication. I attended all regular meetings and contacted the team by messenger every time the task seems ambiguous for me. I participated in the project actively by requesting feedback for the quality of the report and contributing myself in the technical tasks." 
        </p>
        <h4>Pham Tran Viet Anh:</h4>
        <p>
          "It is such a great experience to work with people from different backgrounds and knowledge. Le Van Vinh is like a brother to me. He guides and supports the whole team with his technical skills in the Information Technology industry and the ability to build a prototype. He’s calm, mature and smart. Lee Ga In is the new member of the team. Even though she joined the group later, she managed to understand the project idea and contribute a lot of work to the team. She’s very nice, supportive and hard-working. She always handed in her part very soon and it really inspired the rest of the team to continue and finish the report. Pham Nguyen Mai Ly is like the “push” of the team. She often encouraged and reminded the team to write the report and complete everything before the deadline. She's a very detail-oriented and careful person. She ensured everyone knew what to write in their parts and kept track of the progress. She double-checked the grammar as well as vocabulary to make the report better and better. She also feedback and had some adjustments with my project idea so it can be more practical and feasible for the team to work on. Phan Tuan Viet, the least-speaking person of the team. He’s very nice and hard-working. He always asked questions and feedback to make sure his writing was on the right track and he can fix any parts as soon as possible. About myself, I can see I performed quite fine in the team. I was in charge of the Plan and Progress part of the project, so I had to communicate and discuss with everyone to reflect what we are doing and how we can achieve this project. As an outgoing and friendly person, I am good at making jokes, calming and relieving stress of everyone in the team.""
        </p>
        <h4>Pham Nguyen Mai Ly:</h4>
        <p>
          "Overall, my team’s performance was extremely productive and efficient as each member performed best at their most preferred skills of the project. Moreover, I believe the effectiveness of communication and collaboration among the team members contributed to the team’s success.

          Particularly, Viet Anh was brilliant and creative in coming up with a project idea which is not only unique in the market, but also able to enhance the human’s life to an extent. Ga-In and I were also responsible and enthusiastic team members who were in charge of managing time, organizing meetings, providing improvement for the project idea, as well as conducting all research related to the project. On the practical side, Van Vinh and Tuan Viet were the main contributors for the building the prototypes, specifically in software and hardware development.
          
          Consequently, all team members have contributed to the success of this IT Project and I evaluate all of them very hardworking and excellent in CSIT knowledge and skills."          
        </p>
        <h4>Pham Tuan Viet:</h4>
        <p>
          "Everyone on my team brilliantly performed their tasks with superb efficiency and properly displayed their strengths as well as shortcomings in this team project. I am utmost impressed with Lee Gain - a late addition to the team - on how quickly she can get her work done and with convincing reasonings. True to his personality type, Viet Anh showed many traits of a team leader, decisive, always staying one step ahead and knowing how to resolve conflicts to keep the team together. Mai Ly is perhaps the most serious and careful person in the team, she would always be the first one to set deadlines, reminding tasks and make sure everyone was on the right track, without her motivation I doubt the team can achieve this level of quality. I often considered Vinh to be the “big brother” of the team due to his rich background on software development and because that he is much older than the rest of the team. With his help, our team successfully got a working prototype to even further visualize this project. To conclude, I think that everyone has contributed equally to this project."

      <h4>What went well?</h4>
      <p>
        Generally, despite some minor conflicts, our team’s working process went extremely smoothly. Although it could be difficult to communicate and understand each other's opinions, as we have a foreigner member; everyone contributed to the project in different ways and that has given us a successful project in the end. There wasn’t a lot of conflict during the whole process, and even when there was one, we resolved the problem very quickly and in a very respectful and positive attitude. Since the team regularly talked to each other and gave helpful feedback, everyone’s part was very good, succinct and integrated.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the core idea of our project was brilliant thanks to the team’s creativity, dynamic and analytical thinking. When there’s a new idea, the team member listens to each other and contributes to that idea very well. Although most team members are a beginner of the IT field and his limited knowledge and skills, the team made a lot of efforts to comprehend the robot in-depth, instead of giving up.
      </p>
      <h4>What could be improved?</h4>
      <p>
        We believe one thing that our team could improve in the future is organizing more face-to-face meetings to speed up completing the project. As we also attended other courses, which our schedules did not really sync, organizing face-to-face meetings was a little bit difficult. Now, with more spare time in semester break, the team members could meet more frequently to continue building the robot as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another problem that we experienced in the first two weeks of working on this project is member recruitment. Initially, our team only has 4 members and only until the 3rd week, we are able to welcome Lee Ga In to the team. This has resulted in serious time-consuming when it comes to finishing tasks, building prototypes and writing the report. Moreover, the process of re-allocating the roles and tasks was complicated due to this issue.
      </p>
      <h4>One thing that was surprising</h4>
      <p>
        An aspect that really surprised us when working together is the advanced knowledge and practical skills in Computer Science/Information Technology of the teammates. To be more specific, Van Vinh has a background in computer language, electrical engineering and some experience working with Arduino microcontroller; which was impressive to me for an Introduction to IT student. Moreover, Ga In was very skillful in using CSS computing language when designing the website. These CSIT knowledge and skills are extremely useful when it comes to increasing the practicality of the project idea and developing both hardware and software of the prototype.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, as final-year Digital Marketing students, Mai Ly, Tuan Viet and Viet Anh have wide knowledge in marketing as well as the skills of using marketing tools. Thus, this is a major advantage for the team to deeply conduct market research and advertise this project in the future.
      </p>
      <h4>One thing we learn from working together</h4>
      <p>
        From working with this group, there are a large number of professional and soft skills that we are able to learn from each other, which could contribute to the employability of our team in the future. Specifically, Le Van Vinh gained new knowledge on marketing, presentation, as well as videography. Meanwhile, Lee Ga In learned effective presentation skills and knowledge about designing and assembly the robotics components. One thing that Mai Ly, Tuan Viet and Viet Anh learned about the group is some interesting knowledge in the field, for example the Arduino microcontroller, as well as good teamwork skills, particularly how to use tools like GitHub to collaborate with other software developers.
