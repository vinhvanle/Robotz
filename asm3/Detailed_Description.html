            <p>
                Our ultimate project objective is building a house management system. The system might be considered as a Smart Butler, who has responsibility for not only supervising every circumstance occurring in the household but also maintaining an optimized environment for the employer. Similarly, the system has mainly two factors which are measuring hazard and doing house chores. Specifically, the machine will estimate possible factors that result in a catastrophe such as fire and inform the report to the user to avoid and prevent an accident. Additionally, it will do housework instead of the user. For instance, the product will automatically activate the washing machine by using a typical network between the product and the machine if the machine is full of clothes. The team anticipates that the system will contribute to declining accidents as well as lead to improve the standard of living.

                The main objectives of the project are building a machine and application. The first goal was designing the multi-functional machine. The capabilities of the product are detecting fire hazard, leak, dust concentration and invasion of a stranger and doing overall house chores such as washing dishes, cleaning and laundry to maintain organized residence of the customer. To accomplish the objective, the team built a robot having cameras, scanners for recognizing risk factors like smoke and wheels for enhanced mobility. Our team also developed an application which makes a connection between user and the product. By utilizing the application based on the Bluetooth, an individual can receive a report containing assessment from the machine. Moreover, they can control the machine directly to prevent any possible risks considering the report and assign chores in the user-preferred time zone regardless of the time and location.
