            <h1 class = "section-heading">Aims</h1>
            <p>
                Our ultimate project objective is building a house management system. The system might be considered as a Smart Butler, who has responsibility for not only supervising every circumstance occurring in the household but also maintaining an optimized environment for the employer. Similarly, the system has mainly two factors which are measuring hazard and doing house chores. Specifically, the machine will estimate possible factors that result in a catastrophe such as fire and inform the report to the user to avoid and prevent an accident. Additionally, it will do housework instead of the user. For instance, the product will automatically activate the washing machine by using a typical network between the product and the machine if the machine is full of clothes. The team anticipates that the system will contribute to declining accidents as well as lead to improve the standard of living.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main objectives of the project are building a machine and application. The first goal was designing the multi-functional machine. The capabilities of the product are detecting fire hazard, leak, dust concentration and invasion of a stranger and doing overall house chores such as washing dishes, cleaning and laundry to maintain organized residence of the customer. To accomplish the objective, the team built a robot having cameras, scanners for recognizing risk factors like smoke and wheels for enhanced mobility. Our team also developed an application which makes a connection between user and the product. By utilizing the application based on the Bluetooth, an individual can receive a report containing assessment from the machine. Moreover, they can control the machine directly to prevent any possible risks considering the report and assign chores in the user-preferred time zone regardless of the time and location.
            </p>
            <h1 class = "section-heading">Plans and Progress</h1>
            <h5 style="text-emphasis">Christmas Break (24/12/2020)</h5>
            <p>              
              During Christmas break, the team discussed a bit about the project idea of each member to find some insights and decide which idea can be upgraded and become the idea for the group assignment. Viet Anh was in Hanoi at that time so the team did not have the choice but to text and call on Messenger. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Mai Ly said she wanted to build a stock prediction system with the base of the Natural Processing Language and Machine Learning. She believes that her idea is feasible, practical and a bit innovative, especially during COVID-19 pandemic because the price and direction of stocks are highly uncertain and unpredictable. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Viet Anh introduced his AI-powered brain chip that can check the health status of a person, cure some physical and mental illnesses and then transmit the whole data to a blockchain system. He supposes that with this tiny chip, every government can easily keep track of people’s health and find faster, practical and more efficient as well as effective solutions to many illnesses but still ensure the privacy of each person. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Van Vinh demonstrated the idea of a robot that is able to go around the house and detect if there is any smoke, water leakage, burglars, etc… The robot will ensure the safety of the property and act like a security guard.
            </p>
            <p>
              After we’ve talked about the project idea of each member, we start evaluating the feasibility, possibility and practicality of it. We agreed that we needed to do more research on the project idea of the other because we cannot fully understand the idea and the technologies to make any decisions. Therefore, we would spend the Christmas break to find information and try to gain more knowledge of everyone’s project. 
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-emphasis">03/01/2021</h5>
            <p>
              The group seemed to forget about the Assignment 3 of this IT course and focus on other courses. Realizing the deadline is coming, Viet Anh started bumping the group chat at the beginning of 2021 and he insisted on making a decision of which project idea the whole team would agree to go for. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Viet Anh and Mai Ly had an insightful debate about their idea plans at the beginning. While Mai Ly thought the idea of a human brain chip would be impossible to create and make a prototype in the meantime, Viet Anh stated that the stock prediction system of Ly would be impractical and simple compared to the financial technology nowadays. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After a long discussion, Van Vinh suggested the team could use his idea for the Assignment 3. He believed that his robot would be useful, handy and possible to build a prototype in two to three weeks. With the background of an Information Technology student and the ability to code, he absolutely persuaded the team to choose the robot idea for Assignment 3. The team ended the meeting with an agreement to conduct more research of the required knowledge and tools to apply for the project.
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-emphasis">04/01/2021</h5>
            <p>
              The group conducted another face-to-face meeting to prepare for the stand-up meeting. Viet Anh wanted to upgrade the robot into a butler robot, equipped with more latest and advanced technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing Services, etc. He claimed that the project focuses on the idea, the application, trends of technology and the creativity. Taking into consideration, Artificial Intelligence will bring more benefits and advantages to the project idea, making the robot more helpful, handy and high-tech to fully meet the goal of making a better life for humans. The team agreed and were ready to “pitch” for the stand-up meeting to receive feedback from the class.
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-emphasis">05/01/2021</h5>
            <p>
              The team presented our project idea. Some asked about whether the robot can go upstairs or downstairs. We clarified that the robot is built as a human with two arms, two legs, etc. so it absolutely can go upstairs/downstairs and perform well like a real human. Another student asked about the waterproofness of the robot. The team strongly believed that in the future, we can find materials and methods to make the robot waterproof (like smartphones), fireproof and dustproof, which strengthens the robot much. 
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-emphasis">12/01/2021</h5>
            <p>
              The team attended the second standup meeting and brought our prototype. After building, coding and testing, our prototype can go around, avoid obstacles and follow a black tape on the ground floor. The prototype was very interesting and attracted the attention of the class. 
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-emphasis">Short-term plans</h5>
            <p>
              With only a few weeks, we believe that we could not build a whole robot to experiment and apply in the real world. We decided to outline our idea, research, build our prototype and leave the further work for next generations to explore and upgrade our robot.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finalizing with the idea of a butler robot that enhances life standard, we started building a mock-up, a prototype and consider this a foundation, a starting point of the project. In 16 weeks, we cannot definitely complete a whole human robot that can serve people’s needs and demands. Hence, we decided to follow an easier strategy: assembling a smart car that can avoid obstacles and go around without our control.
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-emphasis">Building the prototype</h5>
            <p>
              Van Vinh used the Arduino Robot to build the prototype. He started buying the robot kit set on linhkientot.vn. He chose the Smart Car KIT Arduino, coming with ultrasonic sensor, remote control module, line tracking module, obstacle avoidance module, motors, wheels, battery, etc. It took the team several hours to build the car and we did not face any challenges. Based on the instructions, we attach pieces and connect parts together in a systematic and seamless way. 
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Link wires with motors and place 4 SG90 motors at 4    corners of a square to assemble the base.
            </p>
            <p> 
               2. Set the base plate onto motors and slide motors mounting through the chassis and link the speed encoders within the motor's inside parts.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Embed caster wheel to the chassis
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Attach wheels to the motors and attach server as well as ultrasonic sensor to the chassis
            </p> 
            <p>
              5. Install the line tracking module
            </p> 
            <p>
              6. Install the Arduino Uno R3 and Shield L293D motor drive chip to the chassis
            </p> 
            <p>
              7. Connect servo pins, motors and ultrasonic sensor to motor drive chip
            </p>  
            <p>
              8. Assemble the battery pack and rocker switch to the chassis and connect them to the motor drive chip
            </p> 
              9. Download Arduino IDE, Program Sketch and upload our project to Arduino Uno
            </p>
            <p>
              There are also 5 analog pins which can be utilized for more sensors, rooms for 2 more motors and a set of servo pins so we can upgrade and enhance the car a bit.
              The bluetooth module facilitates the connection from the robot to the phone so we can control it. The three LEDs, line tracking modules under the eyes are for following any black tap stuck on the ground.. Certainly, its eyes are the ultrasonic sensor which helps it to know its surroundings and avoid obstacles. The Arduino chip controller is where magic happens. It is the brain of the robot. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The main task, obviously the most challenging and important part is how we make it run, how we make it operate and avoid obstacles. Since we bought the Smart Car Arduino kit, we used the Arduino IDE 1.8.13 provided by Arduino. This open-source tool simplifies the coding process, which is easier for students like us to start and learn coding. 
            </p>
            <p>Van Vinh used C programming language to code for the car and its function. He faced a challenge that each wheel will have different controllers and consequently he was having difficulties in finding a way to make it turn left/right at the same time. 
            </p>
            <h5 style="text-emphasis">Future plan</h5>
            <p>
              The robot, as we expect in the long journey, will be built and upgraded to look like a real human. The inner parts are made from steel, aluminum to protect wires, chips and electrical and technical parts. We will include a packing material, which is made of rubber or new material to coat these parts and make them waterproof. The biodegradable materials are used to create a skin like a human, and would be the outer cover to protect the machine from water, fire and other threats. With the shape as a human, the AZ Butler can walk, run, bring things, cook, write, etc. easily and smoothly. And lastly, the next generation will upgrade the robot with Artificial Intelligence to provide the ability to learn and quickly adapt. With Artificial Intelligence, the robot can learn and remember the house map, neighborhood, the family host, friends and relatives, scenarios and many things in such a real life so it can understand and serve our life at the best. First of all, it needs to detect, what is a human, what is a dog, what is a tree, what is an object, the difference between them, etc for the safety of people, pets and the overall environment. The knowledge can be gained and taught by complicated algorithms, codes and information stored in Big Data and Cloud Computing. The robot needs to automatically update and sync with the system to input and output the information. For instance, when it faces a challenge like buying an apple, it needs to retrieve the information of the supermarket, the way to get there, the brand of the apple that the family prefers, the amount, the cost, the way to pick a good apple, etc. If one of the listed information is not in its data, it needs to learn, analyze and try many times by themselves before it can successfully “know” it and put the new lessons into the system. Testing and testing the robot multiple times before it can reach the end-users is very important and essential. Obviously, before launching the product, we have to find investors that have interest in our products and decide to manufacture them in a large number. Then we have to do marketing and campaigns to finally launch the product and sell it to customers.
